# About me 

* * *

I'm Amanda. Nice to meet you!
I am Brazilian, former biologist, still very evolutionist :)
Since 2016 I decided to change my career path, and now I'm happy to work with technology. 

I believe a work environment needs to be respectful, diverse, and that people need to be comfortable to say what they don't know and keep learning every day.

I can dedicate myself 200% when I genuinely believe in something, and I enjoy being part of meaningful projects. I'm 
communicative, organized, and I can always put myself in someone else shoes. 
 
I love being around people (and animals), traveling, learning (especially about new cultures and languages), and cooking.

### Few notes about myself:

- I started studying software development in January/2016 (after finishing my master's degree).

- I began to work with software development in August/2016. 

- In my two first years as a software developer, I  built an entire system, worked for a big company in my city, and contributed to open source projects.

- I can say that technology made me see  I am capable of anything! there is nothing impossible when I compromise with a plan.

- My dream is to become a digital nomad and work remotely from different places around the world!
